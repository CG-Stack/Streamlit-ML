# Displaying text

Here are some links to help you get started with Streamlit, your new secret
weapon:

Streamlit reports usually start with a call to `st.title` to set the
report's title. After that, there are 2 heading levels you can use:
`st.header` and `st.subheader`.

Pure text is entered with `st.text`, and Markdown with
`st.markdown`.

We also offer a "swiss-army knife" command called `st.write`, which accepts
multiple arguments, and multiple data types.

```eval_rst
.. autofunction:: streamlit.text
.. autofunction:: streamlit.markdown
.. autofunction:: streamlit.write
.. autofunction:: streamlit.title
.. autofunction:: streamlit.header
.. autofunction:: streamlit.subheader
```
