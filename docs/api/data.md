Displaying data
===============

When you're working with data, it is extremely valuable to visualize that
data quickly, interactively, and from multiple different angles. That's what
Streamlit is actually built and optimized for.

You can display data via [charts](/api/charts), and you can display it in
raw form. Below are the Streamlit commands you can use to display raw data.

```eval_rst
.. autofunction:: streamlit.dataframe
.. autofunction:: streamlit.table
.. autofunction:: streamlit.json
```
