# Tests

## Summary

As I'm moving around files and bulding up functionality in Armando's `2.7` branch, I'm compiling here a list of tests which I'm running which we can eventually compile into a test suite.

## Tests

- If you have a file called `test.py`, `urllib.py`, or `dbm.py` in your cwd, then streamlit will fail when calling `setup_2_3_shims()`.
