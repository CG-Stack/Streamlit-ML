# TODO(aaj-st): Find a better way to make testing work without having to
#               hardcode entrypoints.  Issue #307 will remove this.
# anaconda2/3-2018.12 has entrypoints 0.2.3 installed, 0.3 which is the
# latest version released 2019.01.07 can't be installed into /opt/conda
# because entrypoints==0.2.3 was installed via distutils,
# so the easiest way to get anaconda?-2018.12 working on circleci is to
