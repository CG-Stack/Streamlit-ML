## Engineering at Streamlit

We're an early stage startup so our engineers wear a number of hats, including:
helping guide the direction of the product, interacting with customers, and
helping optimize our internal processes.

We love what we do, so we tend to work hard — but we also value life outside of
work: half of us have young children, some of us block our calendars to go
running every day, one person has a kickass punk band, and another has dance
performances every month. We like to make sure everyone has time to do the
things they value the most.

## Our stack

Streamlit is a multifaceted product composed of (1) a library that users run on
their own computers/remote machines/containers, (2) a web app, and (3) a cloud
service. We are built on Python, Protocol Buffers, JavaScript, React,
ImmutableJS, AWS, GitHub, and CircleCI.

## What you’ll be doing

* Building a ground-breaking tool that enable data scientists and machine
  learning engineers to interact with and visualize numerical libraries (Numpy,
  Pandas, PyTorch, Tensorflow, SciPy, OpenCV, etc.)
* Designing and implementing prototype machine learning projects to test
  various Streamlit workflows
* Using Streamlit and bringing new ideas to the table on how to improve it

## What you bring

* You’re a seasoned Pythonista
* You are comfortable using machine learning libraries such as Numpy, Pandas,
  PyTorch, Keras, Tensorflow, SciPy, and OpenCV
* You have used different tools and dev environments for data science / ML,
  such as iPython, Jupyter, RStudio, Shiny, Plotly, and Tensorboard
* You have experience working in a team and/or in a large codebase
* You’re a master at the modern suite of engineering tools, like CircleCI and
  Github
* Bachelor’s in CS, Engineering or related field or equivalent training / work
  experience

## Level up bonus points

* You know some Frontend too — you have experience with functional, imperative,
  and reactive programming in React, Javascript, and Typescript.
* You know some Backend too — you’ve built production-ready backends, or dealt
  with server deployments using Docker, Github, Apache Arrow, and various AWS
  technologies including EC2, S3, and CloudFormation.
