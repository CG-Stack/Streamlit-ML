## Engineering at Streamlit

We're an early stage startup so our engineers wear a number of hats, including:
helping guide the direction of the product, interacting with customers, and
helping optimize our internal processes.

We love what we do, so we tend to work hard — but we also value life outside of
work: half of us have young children, some of us block our calendars to go
running every day, one person has a kickass punk band, and another has dance
performances every month. We like to make sure everyone has time to do the
things they value the most.

## Our stack

Streamlit is a multifaceted product composed of (1) a library that users run on
their own computers/remote machines/containers, (2) a web app, and (3) a cloud
service. We are built on Python, Protocol Buffers, JavaScript, React,
ImmutableJS, AWS, GitHub, and CircleCI.

## What you’ll be doing

* Working with the team to build a ground-breaking web app for Data Scientists
  and Machine Learning engineers
* Working closely with a world-class UX and visual designer to build an elegant
  and highly polished user experience
* Collaborating with other engineers on technical designs
* Using Streamlit and interacting with users, gathering insight, and
  bringing new ideas to the table on how to improve the product

## What you bring

* You consistently deliver high quality  user interfaces
* You have experience with functional, imperative, and reactive programming in
  React, Javascript, and Typescript
* You have experience working in a team and/or in a large codebase
* You have experience with the infinite joys of CSS, including layout features
  like flexbox and grid
* You’re a master at the modern suite of engineering tools, like CircleCI and
  Github
* Bachelor’s in CS, Engineering or related field or equivalent training / work
  experience

## Level up bonus points
* You know some Backend too — you’ve built production-ready backends, or dealt
  with server deployments using Docker, Github, Apache Arrow, and various AWS
  technologies including EC2, S3, and CloudFormation.
* You know some Machine Learning / Data Science too — you are comfortable with
  Python and/or using machine learning libraries such as Numpy, Pandas,
  PyTorch, Keras, Tensorflow, SciPy, and OpenCV.
