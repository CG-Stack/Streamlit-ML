## Engineering at Streamlit

We're an early stage startup so our engineers wear a number of hats, including:
helping guide the direction of the product, interacting with customers, and
helping optimize our internal processes.

We love what we do, so we tend to work hard — but we also value life outside of
work: half of us have young children, some of us block our calendars to go
running every day, one person has a kickass punk band, and another has dance
performances every month. We like to make sure everyone has time to do the
things they value the most.

## Our stack

Streamlit is a multifaceted product composed of (1) a library that users run on
their own computers/remote machines/containers, (2) a web app, and (3) a cloud
service. We are built on Python, Protocol Buffers, JavaScript, React,
ImmutableJS, AWS, GitHub, and CircleCI.

## What you’ll be doing

* Working with the team to design and build a new latency-sensitive web service
  from the ground up
* Working with the team to set up, optimize, and maintain our cloud
  infrastructure
* Collaborating with other engineers on technical designs
* Using Streamlit and interacting with users, gathering insight, and
  bringing new ideas to the table on how to improve the product

## What you bring

* You excel at writing Python servers and/or libraries
* You’ve dealt with large-scale server deployments using Docker, Github, Apache
  Arrow, and/or various AWS technologies including EC2, S3, and CloudFormation
* You have experience working in a team and/or in a large codebase
* You’re a master at the modern suite of engineering tools, like CircleCI and
  Github
* Bachelor’s in CS, Engineering or related field or equivalent training / work
  experience

## Level up bonus points

* You know some Frontend too — you have experience with functional, imperative,
  and reactive programming in React, Javascript, and Typescript.
* You know some Machine Learning / Data Science too — you are comfortable
  using machine learning libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, Keras,
  Tensorflow, SciPy, and OpenCV.
