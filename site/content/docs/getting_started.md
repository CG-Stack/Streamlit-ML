title: "Getting Started"

Installing Streamlit is one-line operation! But first there are some
prerequisites that we must get out of the out of the way:

1. Streamlit requires Python 2.7 or higher, or 3.0 or higher.
2. You'll also need the `pip` tool for installing Python packages.

## Installation

You can install Streamlit by typing the following line into a terminal:

```bash
$ pip install streamlit
```

**...and you're done!** So now you can go ahead and try launching our
quick-reference page, which is itself written as a Streamlit report:

```bash
$ python -m streamlit help
```

This last command should open a new tab in your web browser.

To finish up, we recommend you **spend a couple of minutes reading the contents
of that tab,** since it is a great crash course on the most important Streamlit
commands.

Next, let's create our [first Streamlit report](/docs/tutorial/).
